 * Creates a new DynamicClient instance.

 * Notice the `autoInitialize` flag is true by default (unless you're running
 * in SSR), so the client will be automatically initialized when created â€” if
 * you want to manually initialize the client, you can set the `autoInitialize`
 * flag to false and then later call the `initializeClient` function.
 *
 * Manually calling `initializeClient` also allows you to catch any potential
 * errors that may occur during initialization.
